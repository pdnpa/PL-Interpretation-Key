## Associated habitat concepts

!!! info "Associated habitat concepts (not to be annotated separately)"
    The habitat types listed below are commonly associated with **{{ title }} ({{ code }})** in ecological and conservation literature.  

    These represent **interpretive or descriptive groupings**, not separate interpretation classes, and should **not** be mapped independently from imagery.

    {% for hab in associated_habitats %}
    - **{{ hab }}**
    {% endfor %}

    Associations are **contextual characteristcis** and will be derived post-mapping.

- Woodland succession
- We have no money!!!!!
- Conservation management for species diversity
