## Definition

{{ description }}

Neutral grassland and meadow includes grasslands developed on neither strongly acidic nor calcareous soils. This class covers a range of management expressions, from grazed neutral grassland to traditionally managed hay meadows.

Meadows are distinguished not by soil type alone, but by **management**, typically involving an annual hay cut followed by aftermath grazing. From aerial imagery, this management distinction is often difficult to confirm reliably.

---

## Identification criteria

This class should be mapped when **all** of the following apply:

- Vegetation forms a **closed grassland sward**
- Grassland occurs on **lowland or upland fringe landscapes** (but not open moorland)
- Sward texture is **more heterogeneous** than improved grassland
- There is **no strong evidence** of calcareous or acidic grassland dominance
- Scrub and trees do not form the dominant canopy

This class commonly occurs:
- Within enclosed agricultural landscapes
- As fields managed for grazing or hay
- In mosaics with hedgerows, scrub, or wet grassland features

---

## Aerial definition

From aerial or satellite imagery, neutral grassland and meadow typically appears as:

- Even to moderately uneven grassland texture
- Variable colour tones reflecting mixed species composition
- Clear field boundaries and agricultural context
- Seasonal cut patterns may be visible, but are **not required** for classification

Where meadow management is uncertain, grassland should still be mapped within this class.

## Associated habitat concepts

!!! info "Associated habitat concepts (not mapped separately)"
    The habitat types listed below are commonly associated with **{{ title }} ({{ code }})** in ecological and conservation literature.

    These are **interpretive or descriptive groupings**, not separate interpretation classes, and should **not** be mapped independently from imagery.

    {% for hab in associated_habitats %}
    - **{{ hab }}**
    {% endfor %}

    Associations are **contextual characteristics** and may be derived post-mapping using management information or field survey data.

## Overlap with other classes

!!! warning "Potential confusion with related classes"
    - [e1 Improved grassland](improved.md)
    - [e2a Acid grassland](acid.md)
    - [e2b Calcareous grassland](calcareous.md)

Use vegetation structure and landscape context to guide interpretation.

## In Protected Landscapes

Neutral grassland and meadow occur widely across Protected Landscapes, particularly where traditional low-intensity farming practices persist. Extent and condition vary considerably depending on management history and agricultural pressure.

---

### Management and drivers

The structure and ecological value of neutral grassland and meadow are influenced by:

- Timing and frequency of cutting
- Grazing pressure and livestock type
- Nutrient inputs
- Scrub control or abandonment

Ecological condition should not be inferred directly from imagery alone.
