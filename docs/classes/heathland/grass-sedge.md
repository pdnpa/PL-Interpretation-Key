  Areas which have the potential to become active blanket bogs. Sphagnum mosses typical of active bogs are scarce, and the area is dominated by grass and sedge. Common species include: purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea), cotton grass (Eriophorum angustifolium) and deer grass (Trichophorum cespitosum).

## Definition

{{ description }}

Molinia–sedge moorland represents open upland vegetation in which grasses and sedges dominate over dwarf shrubs. These habitats occur within unenclosed moorland landscapes and are typically associated with acidic, nutrient-poor soils influenced by hydrology, grazing, and historic management. Vegetation is dominated by graminoids such as purple moor grass, cotton grass or deer grass with sphagnum bog mosses scarce or absent. 

This class captures a range of grass–sedge dominated moorland expressions, including Molinia-rich areas and sedge lawns, often forming transitional mosaics with upland heath and blanket bog.

## Identification criteria

This class should be mapped when:

* Vegetation is dominated by grasses and/or sedges
* Dwarf shrubs are sparse or absent
* Habitat occurs within open or weakly enclosed moorland landscapes
* Vegetation forms extensive or semi-continuous cover

This class commonly occurs:

* Along moorland slopes and plateaus
* In association with flushes, damp ground, or degraded peat surfaces
* Adjacent to upland heath or blanket bog

## Aerial Definition

From aerial imagery, Molinia–sedge moorland typically appears as:

* Smooth or softly textured vegetation relative to heath
* Broad, continuous swards with limited fine-scale patterning
* Seasonal colour change, often showing pale or straw tones outside the growing season
* Boundaries aligned with moisture gradients or topography

Species composition (e.g. Molinia dominance) cannot be confirmed reliably from imagery alone.

## Associated habitat concepts

!!! info "Associated habitat concepts (not mapped separately)"
    The habitat types listed below are commonly associated with grass and/or sedge dominated in ecological and conservation literature.  

    These represent **interpretive or descriptive groupings**, not separate interpretation classes, and should **not** be mapped independently from imagery.

    {% for hab in associated_habitats %}
    - {{ hab }}
    {% endfor %}

    Associations depend on landscape context, management history, and underlying soils, and may vary considerably within this class and will be classified after interpretation.

## Overlap with other classes

    * Enclosed or managed grazing land → **E2a Upland acid grassland**

### Management and drivers

The structure and extent of Molinia–sedge moorland are influenced by:

* Hydrology and peat condition
* Grazing pressure
* Burning history
* Atmospheric nutrient inputs

Ecological condition should not be inferred directly from imagery alone.
