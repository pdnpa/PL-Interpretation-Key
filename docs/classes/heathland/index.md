description: >
  Land dominated by low (dwarf) shrub species, generally forming part of a succession from grassland to woodland but maintained through burning, cutting and grazing, e.g. moorlands. Includes grass moor as visually distinct from acid grassland and important as a transition between degraded (molinia dominated) landscapes and transition to blanket bog. Excludes seasonally and/or permanently wet areas, e.g. peat bogs.

## Definition

{{ description }}

## Identification criteria

*This class should be mapped when:*
- XXX vegetation <5 m tall covers >XX% of the polygon
- Vegetation has clearly defined edges
- Dominated by XXX rather than tree canopy

## Aerial Definition

*examples of aerial photography annotations etc....*

## In Protected Landscapes

*where and which PL's this is likely found*

### Management and drivers

*Dense scrub may be maintained by:*
- Reduced grazing pressure
- Woodland succession
- We have no money!!!!!
- Conservation management for species diversity

## Useful Links

*useufl links to open data to help with interpretation e.g. FC Woodland Data or OS or CEH*
