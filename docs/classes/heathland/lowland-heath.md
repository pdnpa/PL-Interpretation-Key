  Typically found on acidic, low nutrient soils, these areas are made up of varying percentages of Heather and heath species (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp.), dwarf gorse (Vaccinium myrtillus) and Crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). Grass species such as Bristle Bent (Agrostis curtisii) and Sheep’s Fescue (Festuca ovina) are also common.

## Definition

{{ description }}

Lowland heath typically occurs in lowland landscapes where acidic soils, low nutrient availability and a history of grazing, burning or cutting have maintained dwarf shrub cover. It often occurs as a patchwork of heath with grassland, bare ground, wet hollows and developing scrub.

---

## Identification criteria

This class should be mapped when:

* Vegetation is dominated by dwarf shrubs (heather/heath-type structure)
* Habitat occurs in a lowland setting (generally below the moorland zone and not within open upland moorland landscapes)
* Heath forms patches or mosaics that are not simply small field-edge strips
* Scrub and trees are not the dominant canopy (if scrub dominates, map as scrub class; if trees dominate, map as woodland)

Lowland heath commonly occurs:

* On heathy commons, sandy or gravelly soils, and lowland plateaus
* As mosaics with acid grassland, bracken, wet heath and scrub
* Adjacent to tracks, rides and disturbed ground where bare patches may occur

---

## Aerial definition

From aerial imagery, lowland heath typically appears as:

* A mottled or textured vegetation surface compared with improved grassland
* Irregular patchwork of dwarf shrubs with interspersed grass/bare ground
* Boundaries that often follow soil and disturbance patterns rather than field edges
* Seasonal colour change, with heath often appearing darker / browner outside peak growing season

Where imagery is ambiguous, use landscape context (lowland vs upland, enclosure pattern, adjacent habitats) to support interpretation.

## Associated habitat concepts

!!! info "Associated habitat concepts (not to be annotated separately)"
    The habitat types listed below are commonly associated with **{{ title }} ({{ code }})** in ecological and conservation literature.  

    These represent **interpretive or descriptive groupings**, not separate interpretation classes, and should **not** be mapped independently from imagery.

    {% for hab in associated_habitats %}
    - **{{ hab }}**
    {% endfor %}

    Associations are **contextual characteristcis** and will be derived post-mapping.

## In Protected Landscapes

Lowland heath is most likely in Protected Landscapes where lowland acidic substrates and historical heathland management persist (e.g., heathy commons, sandy/gravelly lowlands, coastal heaths where present). Extent is typically fragmented and often occurs as mosaics within wider semi-natural land.

---

### Management and drivers

Lowland heath structure and extent are influenced by:

* Grazing pressure and grazing type (ponies, cattle, sheep)
* Cutting, burning or rotational management
* Scrub encroachment in the absence of management
* Hydrological change affecting wet heath components
* Atmospheric nitrogen deposition and nutrient enrichment

Ecological condition should not be inferred directly from imagery alone.
