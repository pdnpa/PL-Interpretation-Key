## Definition

{{ description }}

Upland heath is characterised by the dominance of dwarf shrubs such as heather (Calluna vulgaris), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). It occurs primarily in open, unenclosed upland landscapes and often forms large, continuous habitat blocks or mosaics with other moorland vegetation types.

---

## Identification criteria

This class should be mapped when all of the following apply:

* Vegetation is dominated by dwarf shrubs
* Habitat occurs within open or weakly enclosed moorland landscapes
* Vegetation forms extensive or semi-continuous cover
* Grass or sedge components are secondary to shrub cover

This class may occur:

* On slopes, plateaus, and ridges
* In mosaics with blanket bog, grass–sedge moorland, or bracken
* In both managed and unmanaged moorland systems

---

## Aerial Definition
From aerial or satellite imagery, upland heath typically appears as:

* Mottled or textured vegetation with fine-grained patterning
* Distinct tonal variation reflecting shrub dominance
* Irregular boundaries aligned with topography rather than field systems
* Seasonal colour variation, often browner or purpler outside peak growing season


*examples of aerial photography annotations etc....*

## Associated habitat concepts

!!! info "Associated habitat concepts (not to be annotated separately)"
    The habitat types listed below are commonly associated with **{{ title }} ({{ code }})** in ecological and conservation literature.  

    These represent **interpretive or descriptive groupings**, not separate interpretation classes, and should **not** be mapped independently from imagery.

    {% for hab in associated_habitats %}
    - **{{ hab }}**
    {% endfor %}

    Associations are **contextual characteristcis** and will be derived post-mapping.

## In Protected Landscapes

*where and which PL's this is likely found*

---

### Management and drivers

The extent and structure of upland heath are influenced by:
* Grazing pressure
* Burning regimes
* Atmospheric deposition
* Historic land use

Ecological condition should be assessed separately from structural interpretation.
