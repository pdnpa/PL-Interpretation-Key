  	Woody scrub species, associated with woodland or transitions to woodland in grassland or heathland habitats. Either having a diffuse boundary with a mix of woody shrubs and trees <5 m in height (with grasses) or in dense patches. These areas can be found within woodland or on the edges of woodland, maintained by grazing or as part of a natural succession to woodland. Includes patches of dense scrub with clear boundaries on heathland, e.g. gorse. Mature tree canopies should be digitised out. This class is separated from the (woodland/heathland/grassland) hierarchy as distinct landscape features.
subclasses: [s1, s1a, s1b, s2]

## Definition

{{ description }}

## Identification criteria

*This class should be mapped when:*
- XXX vegetation <5 m tall covers >XX% of the polygon
- Vegetation has clearly defined edges
- Dominated by XXX rather than tree canopy

## Aerial Definition

*examples of aerial photography annotations etc....*

## In Protected Landscapes

*where and which PL's this is likely found*

### Management and drivers

*Dense scrub may be maintained by:*
- Reduced grazing pressure
- Woodland succession
- We have no money!!!!!
- Conservation management for species diversity

## Useful Links

*useufl links to open data to help with interpretation e.g. FC Woodland Data or OS or CEH*
