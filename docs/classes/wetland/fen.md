description: >
  Areas that are waterlogged, either permanently or periodically, and are often peat-forming. Fens receive groundwater, rainfall and water from surface run-off, separating them from bogs where the peat forming vegetation is isolated from groundwater. Marshes are dominated by herbaceous plants; swamps are dominated by trees and tall, emergent vegetation.
