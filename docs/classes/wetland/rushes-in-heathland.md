## Definition

{{ description }}

## Identification criteria
In open upland contexts this class often aligns with habitats described as upland acid grassland and rush pasture and may include areas dominated by purple moor-grass, particularly where historic grazing and burning have influenced vegetation structure.

This class should be mapped when:
- Occurs in unenclosed or weakly enclosed upland landscapes
- Tussocky vegetation forms extensive or semi-continuous cover, rather than isolated patches
- Internal field boundaries are absent or minimal
- Commonly occurs along moorland fringes, slopes, or in association with damp ground and flushes

## In Protected Landscapes

*where and which PL's this is likely found*

### Management and drivers

*Dense scrub may be maintained by:*
- Reduced grazing pressure
- Woodland succession
- We have no money!!!!!
- Conservation management for species diversity
