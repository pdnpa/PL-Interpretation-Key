## Definition

{{ description }}

## Identification criteria
In enclosed settings this class often corresponds to habitats described as purple moor-grass and rush pasture, typically containing a mixture of rushes, coarse grasses and sedges. Species composition cannot always be reliably determined from imagery.

This class should be mapped when:
- Occurs within clearly enclosed landscapes (fields bounded by hedges, walls, fences)
- Tussocky vegetation forms patches, linear features, or irregular areas within otherwise managed grassland
- Vegetation texture is coarse and uneven, contrasting with surrounding improved pasture
- Drainage features (blocked grips, flushes, hollows) are visible or implied

### Management and drivers
Much of this wet grassland is estimated to have been lost in the Protected Landscapes in the last two decades of the 20th century due to drainage and changes in rush management increasing nutrients in the soil. 

This priority habitat is essential for breeding waders such as lapwing and snipe. Despite being relatively species poor, it also supports some once-widespread plants such as ragged robin and devil’s bit scabious.
