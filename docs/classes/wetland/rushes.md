## Definition

{{ description }}

Wet grassland and rush pasture includes a range of wet, tussocky vegetation types that develop where soils are permanently or seasonally waterlogged. These habitats occur primarily in response to local hydrological conditions rather than active management and may be found across both lowland and upland landscapes.

## Identification criteria
This class should be mapped when the following apply:

- Vegetation forms a clearly tussocky, uneven sward
- Texture is coarse and contrasts with surrounding grassland, heath, or moorland
- Distribution and pattern indicate control by water availability (e.g. hollows, flushes, gullies, blocked drains)
- Vegetation height is generally less than 5 m and not dominated by scrub or trees

This class may occur as:

- Extensive continuous areas
- Patchy or irregular features
- Linear bands following drainage lines or topographic features

---

## Aerial Definition
From aerial or satellite imagery, wet grassland and rush pasture typically appears as:

- Darker or muted green or brown tones compared with grassland or grass moors
- Rough or mottled texture caused by tussocks
- Irregular boundaries that follow hydrological patterns rather than field edges
- Persistent wetness signals relative to surrounding land

Seasonal colour variation may be evident. Species composition cannot be reliably determined from imagery alone** and should not be inferred at the interpretation stage.

## Associated habitat concepts

!!! info "Associated habitat concepts (not to be annotated separately)"
    The habitat types listed below are commonly associated with **{{ title }} ({{ code }})** in ecological and conservation literature.  

    These represent **interpretive or descriptive groupings**, not separate interpretation classes, and should **not** be mapped independently from imagery.

    {% for hab in associated_habitats %}
    - **{{ hab }}**
    {% endfor %}

    Associations are **contextual characteristcis** and will be derived post-mapping.

## In Protected Landscapes

Wet grassland and rush pasture occurs widely across Protected Landscapes, particularly:

- In marginal or poorly drained agricultural land
- Along moorland fringes and upland slopes
- Within fens, flushes, basins, and wet hollows

Extent, condition, and ecological value vary substantially and should be assessed using field survey or ancillary datasets rather than imagery alone.

---

## Management and drivers

The distribution and character of wet grassland and rush pasture are influenced by:

- Hydrological modification (drainage, drain blocking)
- Grazing pressure and livestock type
- Nutrient enrichment
- Historic land-use practices

Both species-rich and species-poor expressions may occur within this class.
