description: >
  Wet grassland habitats characterised by tussocky, coarse vegetation associated with poorly drained soils, seasonal waterlogging, or impeded drainage. Vegetation structure is typically dominated by rushes and/or coarse grasses, occurring in both enclosed agricultural landscapes and open upland contexts.
subclasses: [f4a, f4b]

## Identification criteria
Habitats within this class fall into two broad landscape contexts:

1. **Open upland settings**, where wet tussocky grassland often occurs within or adjacent to heath, blanket bog, or upland acid grassland and may reflect long-term grazing and burning impacts.
2. **Enclosed or managed settings**, where similar vegetation structure occurs within fields, fens, or marginal areas of intensively farmed landscapes.

Ecological composition may vary (e.g. rush- or Molinia-dominated), but classification at this level ßis based on remotely observable vegetation structure and landscape context, rather than species-level certainty.

Where wet tussocky grassland occurs in transitional or ambiguous settings, classification should prioritise landscape context (enclosed vs open) over inferred species dominance.

This class should be mapped when:
- There is presence of a thick tussocky sward of rushes and coarse grasses.
- Tussocky vegetation may occur as discrete patches or as more extensive cover, depending on landscape context.
- Vegetation has clearly defined edges compared with surrounding habitats.

## In Protected Landscapes

*where and which PL's this is likely found*

### Management and drivers

*Dense scrub may be maintained by:*
- Reduced grazing pressure
- Woodland succession
- We have no money!!!!!
- Conservation management for species diversity
