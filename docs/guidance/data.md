# Aerial Photo Interpretation

Land cover refers to the physical elements occupying the Earth’s surface. It is a key variable for monitoring Category V protected landscapes, where human activity—primarily agriculture and forestry—continues to shape landscape structure and function. Systematic survey, monitoring and evaluation are essential for understanding the condition and management trajectory (improving, stable or declining) of protected areas, sites, habitats and species.

## Aerial Photography 
Aerial photography can be challenging to interpret and analyse. Cartographic maps present features that have already been standardised to aid understanding, whereas aerial photographs contain raw visual information captured by a camera from thousands of feet above the Earth’s surface. Photographic interpreters and imagery analysts therefore apply a range of visual and analytical techniques to extract meaningful and consistent information from these images.

### Bluesky
Bluesky’s catalogue of high-resolution orthophotography is accurate, up to date and GIS/CAD-ready. The imagery is produced to the highest technical standards and is accredited to Ordnance Survey Accuracy (±0.5 m RMSE). Data is captured at 12.5cm resolution aquired between 1st April and 31st October acquired with Vexcel UltraCams. 

**Products used:**

* 12.5cm Aerial Photo
* 50cm Colour Infrared
* 25cm Digitial Surface Model

### Limitations Seasonality
Weather conditions influence both the timing and quality of image acquisition. Light conditions vary with time of day, while seasonal timing affects sunlight intensity and angle. In an ideal scenario, all photography used in a survey of this type would be captured during a single acquisition window. In practice, imagery was collected over multiple years.

While this is not unusual in landscape-scale aerial surveys, it introduces challenges in distinguishing vegetation types and conditions. Differences in acquisition timing complicate the interpretation of land cover, particularly when surveys span multiple growing seasons.

As shown in Figure 1, the imagery used was collected over a four-year period, spanning mid-meteorological spring to early summer. Surveying vegetation across this period introduces substantial phenological variation, including differences in flowering, leaf emergence, canopy development and chlorophyll content.

In addition, much of the landscape is actively managed. Agricultural practices such as fertiliser application, grazing regimes and grass cutting for fodder can rapidly alter vegetation structure and appearance, further complicating classification.

**Figure 2:** illustrates the range of visual differences observed across the imagery dataset. Additional land-cover-specific challenges are described in the relevant subclass sections below.

## Background Reports

### Landscape Change in National Parks (CCP359)
This Countryside Commission report (1991) presents a comprehensive assessment of landscape change across National Parks in England and Wales. The study compared aerial photography from the 1970s with imagery from the late 1980s, enabling systematic analysis of changes in land cover, as well as linear and point landscape features.

The project involved the manual digitisation of all National Parks in England and Wales over a four-year period. The resulting dataset formed a key evidence base informing the establishment of National Park Authorities under the Environment Act (1995).

### Multi-Stage Semantic Segmentation Quantifies Fragmentation of Small Habitats at a Landscape Scale
This 2023 study demonstrates the application of deep learning methods to digitise high-resolution aerial photography. A pilot study in the Peak District National Park showed that multi-stage semantic segmentation can be used to quantify habitat fragmentation at landscape scale, demonstrating the feasibility of applying these methods to large protected areas.
