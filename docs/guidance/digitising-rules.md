# Digitising rules

This page sets out the core rules to be followed when digitising habitats and land cover using this interpretation key.

The aim is to ensure **consistent, repeatable outputs** across different operators, areas and times.

---

## General principles

- Digitisation should be based on **visual interpretation of aerial imagery**
- Class assignment should reflect the **dominant visible cover**
- Boundaries should prioritise **consistency over precision**

---

## Minimum mapping unit (MMU)

- The default minimum mapping unit is **[X] m²**
- Features smaller than the MMU should:
  - be absorbed into the surrounding dominant class, or
  - digitised only where explicitly specified (e.g. linear features)

---

## Polygon geometry

- Polygons should be:
  - simple and smooth
  - free from unnecessary vertices
- Avoid:
  - tracing individual plants
  - following shadows or seasonal artefacts
- Boundaries should follow:
  - clear visual breaks
  - management boundaries where visible and relevant

---

## Linear and narrow features

- Linear features (e.g. hedgerows, walls, watercourses) should:
  - be digitised as polygons where width is consistently visible
  - otherwise be represented according to project-specific rules

---

## Mixed and transitional habitats

Where habitats are mixed or transitional:

1. Identify the **dominant visual component**
2. Assign the class based on **areal dominance**
3. Avoid splitting polygons unless:
   - a clear internal boundary exists
   - both components exceed the MMU

---

## Seasonal and imagery considerations

- Leaf-on vs leaf-off conditions should be accounted for
- Temporary effects (e.g. drought, flooding, grazing) should not override:
  - long-term structural characteristics

---

## Common digitising errors to avoid

- Over-fragmentation of polygons
- Inconsistent treatment of edges
- Using local knowledge not visible in imagery
