# Quality assurance (QA)

This page outlines the quality assurance checks to be applied to digitised data produced using this interpretation key.

QA is essential to ensure datasets are suitable for downstream analysis and AI training.

---

## QA objectives

Quality assurance aims to:
- identify systematic errors
- ensure consistency between operators
- confirm alignment with digitising rules and thresholds

---

## Visual QA checks

- Are polygons topologically valid?
- Are boundaries consistent with imagery?
- Are obvious misclassifications present?

---

## Thematic QA checks

- Are similar features classified consistently?
- Are transitional habitats treated consistently?
- Are rare classes used appropriately?

---

## Cross-operator consistency

Where multiple operators are involved:
- review overlapping areas
- compare class proportions
- discuss and resolve discrepancies

---

## Attribute and schema checks

- Are all required attributes populated?
- Are codes valid and consistent?
- Are deprecated or placeholder classes avoided?

---

## Common QA issues

- Overuse of fine-grained classes
- Inconsistent use of scrub vs woodland
- Misclassification driven by seasonal artefacts

---

## Sign-off and versioning

- QA checks should be documented
- Data releases should be versioned
- Known limitations should be recorded
