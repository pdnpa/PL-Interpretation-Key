## Introduction

This interpretation key provides guidance for the **digitisation of habitats and land cover** across protected landscapes in England.

It is designed to support the creation of **consistent, high-quality spatial data** for use in training and validating artificial intelligence (AI) models. The focus is on how habitats and land cover types should be **identified and interpreted from aerial imagery**, rather than on detailed field-based ecology.

The key builds on existing classification systems, including **UKHab**, while introducing additional distinctions that are necessary for image-based digitising and machine learning applications.

## Purpose of the key

This interpretation key aims to:

- provide a **clear and consistent decision framework** for digitising habitats and land cover
- reduce ambiguity between similar or transitional habitat types
- support **repeatable, scalable digitisation** across multiple protected landscapes
- enable the production of training datasets suitable for AI and automated mapping approaches

---

## How to use this site

- Start with the **Guidance** section for general digitising rules and thresholds
- Use the **Schema** page to browse the full classification structure
- Click individual habitat classes to view:
  - definitions and decision rules  
  - visual interpretation guidance  
  - example imagery and edge cases

This site is intended to be used alongside aerial imagery and GIS software during the digitisation process.

---

## Scope and limitations

This key is designed for **remote interpretation** using aerial imagery. It does not replace detailed field survey guidance and should not be used for statutory habitat condition assessment.

Where habitats form **gradual transitions**, the key prioritises visual dominance and spatial coherence to support consistent digitisation.

---

## Versioning and development

This interpretation key is a **living document** and will continue to evolve as methods, imagery and AI approaches develop.

Updates and refinements will be version-controlled through GitHub to maintain transparency and traceability.
