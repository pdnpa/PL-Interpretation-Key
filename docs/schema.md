| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [a](classes/a/index.md) | Artificial land | u | Buildings, roads, built-up areas, artificially sealed surfaces, and quarries |

### Subclasses

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|

| [a3](classes/a/a3.md) | Open mosaic | u1a | Habitat found on previously disturbed or industrial land (brownfields) featuring a mix of bare ground, sparse vegetation (grasses, wildflowers, mosses), and sometimes pools, creating rich areas for rare invertebrates (insects) and reptiles |

## Cropland (b)

### Primary class

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [b](classes/b/index.md) | Cropland | c | Land used for growing crops |

### Subclasses

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [b1](classes/b/b1.md) | Annual crops | c1c | Crops that complete their growing cycle within a year. |
| [b2](classes/b/b2.md) | Permanent crops (vines, bushes, energy crops) | c1d | Crops from plants that produce harvests year on year, and so are not grown in rotation, but occupy the same area/field year on year. |
| [b3](classes/b/b3.md) | Orchards | c1 | Collections of fruit and/or nut producing trees, currently managed for food production, with an intensely managed ground cover. |

---

## Woodland (c)

### Primary class

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [c](classes/c/index.md) | Woodland | w | Trees & woodland canopies |

### Subclasses

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [c1](classes/c/c1.md) | Broadleaved woodland | w1 | Areas dominated by trees >5m tall. There must be a tree canopy cover of at least ???%, with ≥???% consisting of deciduous, broadleaved species. Includes ancient and recent woodland, with trees that have grown from seed or planted seedlings. Tends to have shades of green and appear full in the summer, with a more brown and sparse appearance in the winter when the leaves have been lost. |
| [c1a](classes/c/c1.md) | Single trees (broadleaved) | w1 | Isolated, broadleaved trees outside woodland. Only includes individual trees; as soon as there are more than one it must be classed as c1. |
| [c1b](classes/c/c1.md) | Hedgerow trees (broadleaved) | w1g6 | Trees (broadleaved) within hedges, either single or lines. |
| [c2](classes/c/c2.md) | Coniferous woodland | w2 | Areas dominated by trees >5m tall. There must be a tree canopy cover of at least ???%, with ≥???% consisting of coniferous species. The majority of coniferous woodlands in the UK are from planted seedlings. Easily recognisable in aerial imagery, as plantations consist of uniformly aged, coloured and spaced trees, often with defined borders. |
| [c2a](classes/c/c2.md) | Single trees (coniferous) | w2 | Isolated, coniferous trees outside woodland. Only includes individual trees; as soon as there are more than one it must be classed as c1. |
| [c2b](classes/c/c2.md) | Hedgerow trees (coniferous) | w1g6 | Trees (coniferous) within hedges, either single or lines. |
| [c4](classes/c/c4.md) | Traditional orchard | BNG21 | Collections of fruit and/or nut producing trees, with low intensity management. The trees are found in more herbaceous ground cover than in an intensive orchard, and this category includes historical or abandoned orchards that still retain their trees. |
| [c5](classes/c/c5.md) | Clear felled/newly planted | BNG53 | Areas of woodland that have been recently felled or planted with new, young trees. Evidence of logging, rowing up of trash and drainage may be present. Newly planted trees can be identified by lines of uniform planting. |

## Scrubland (s)

### Primary class

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [s](classes/s/index.md) | Scrubland | h3 | Woody scrub species, associated with woodland or transitions to woodland in grassland or heathland habitats. Either having a diffuse boundary with a mix of woody shrubs and trees <5 m in height (with grasses) or in dense patches. These areas can be found within woodland or on the edges of woodland, maintained by grazing or as part of a natural succession to woodland. Includes patches of dense scrub with clear boundaries on heathland, e.g. gorse. Mature tree canopies should be digitised out. This class is separated from the (woodland/heathland/grassland) hierarchy as distinct landscape features. |

### Subclasses

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [s1](classes/s/s1.md) | Scrub | h3 | Areas of shrubs <5m in height with >???% cover. Species may include Blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), Hazel (Corylus avellana), Bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.) and Willow (Salix spp.), amongst others. |
| [s1a](classes/s/s1.md) | Mixed dense scrub | h3 | Areas of scrub which contain multiple different species, with no one species dominating. Alternatively, areas of scrub dominated by a single species which isn’t Gorse (s1b). |
| [s1b](classes/s/s1.md) | Gorse | h3e | Areas are covered by at least ???% Gorse. European Gorse (Ulex europaeus) dominates; Dwarf Gorse (Ulex minor) and Western Gorse (Ulex gallii) may also be present. Appears dark green, or is a distinct bright yellow when flowering. |
| [s2](classes/s/s2.md) | Hedgerows | h2 | Lines of shrubs <???m wide and <???m tall. Even though some species within the hedgerow may be capable of growing taller into trees, their shorter nature in this context results in the linear feature appearing as a ‘shrubby’ hedgerow. Often found at the boundaries of fields or bordering roads. |

## Heathland (d)

### Primary class

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [d](classes/d/index.md) | Heathland | h1 | Land dominated by low (dwarf) shrub species, generally forming part of a succession from grassland to woodland but maintained through burning, cutting and grazing, e.g. moorlands. Includes grass moor as visually distinct from acid grassland and important as a transition between degraded (molinia dominated) landscapes and transition to blanket bog. Excludes seasonally and/or permanently wet areas, e.g. peat bogs. |

### Subclasses

| Code | Name | Closest UKHab | Definition |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| [d1](classes/d/d1.md) | Upland heath | h1 | Typically found on acidic, low nutrient soils, these are areas consisting of >???% cover of Heather and heath species (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp.) and/or Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). Crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) may also be present. Management of upland heath can include regular patch burning, which can be easily identified aerially. |
| [d1a](classes/d/d1.md) | Upland dry heath | h1b5 | Generally found in areas with low nutrient, acidic to circumneutral soils, which drain freely. Heather (Calluna vulgaris) and heath (Erica spp.) dominated, with other dwarf shrubs including Bilberry (Vaccinium spp.) and Crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). |
| [d1b](classes/d/d1.md) | Dwarf shrub dominated blanket bog | h1b6 | Predominantly inactive bog areas. Dwarf shrub cover - including Heather and heath species (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp.) – exceeds 75% of the canopy, and mosses (e.g. Sphagnum) are extremely rare if not completely absent. |
| [d2](classes/d/d2.md) | Grass/sedge dominated blanket bog | b1 | Areas which have the potential to become active blanket bogs. Sphagnum mosses typical of active bogs are scarce, and the area is dominated by grass and sedge. Common species include: purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea), cotton grass (Eriophorum angustifolium) and deer grass (Trichophorum cespitosum). |
| [d2a](classes/d/d2.md) | Dry grass/sedge dominated blanket bog | b1 (Blanket bog – degraded / modified) | Hydrological state captured as attribute |
| [d2b](classes/d/d2.md) | Wet grass/sedge dominated blanket bog | b1 (Blanket bog – wetter expression)  | THydrological state captured as attribute |
| [d3](classes/d/d3.md) | Bracken | glc | Areas are covered by at least ???% Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Variable in colour and appearance, it appears bright green and bushy in the summer, but russet-brown when the plant material has died. |
| [d4](classes/d/d4.md) | Lowland heath | h1a | Typically found on acidic, low nutrient soils, these areas are made up of varying percentages of Heather and heath species (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp.), dwarf gorse (Vaccinium myrtillus) and Crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). Grass species such as Bristle Bent (Agrostis curtisii) and Sheep’s Fescue (Festuca ovina) are also common. |

* Where the interpretation key distinguishes habitat states (e.g. dry vs wet blanket bog) that are not formally separated in UKHab, all variants are mapped to the closest UKHab parent class, with condition captured through interpretation attributes.
